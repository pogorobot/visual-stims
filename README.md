# Visual Stims

[Demo](http://pogorobot.github.io/visual-stims/)

Sometimes it's nice to watch the patterns dance,  
To grow and change their structure and their heart.  
Sometimes it's nice to fall into in a trance,  
Ignoring worried words like, "Is this art?"

You watch it, and you tingle, and you know  
That something in this universe is real.  
You're not quite sure just what that thing might be,  
Just like you're not quite sure just how you feel.

But it you follow, if you're me, and do.  
It leads you down a tangled, branching path.  
It shows you things you think are good for you,  
like spirals, spiders, vegan food, and math.  

And anyway, hey look, I made this toy.  
I hope you try it, like it, and enjoy!
